# Snippets
Snippets I use in VS Code to save some typing.

[cpp.json](cpp.json) is my VS Code User snippets file for C++, usually placed in `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\` in Windows.  
  
The same snippets have been documented in the `.cpp` files, with file templates in individual `.cpp` files and code snippets in [others.cpp](others.cpp)
